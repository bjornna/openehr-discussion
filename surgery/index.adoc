= Surgery and openEHR archetypes 

== Background
Surgery is an important activity in hospitals. It requires good planning, quality in execution and the right post-operative documentation. 

1. Surgery is requested using http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.476[openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.request-procedure.v1] and put it into an http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.640[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.request.v1].
2. To document what was performed we use http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.16[openEHR-EHR-ACTION.procedure.v1] and  put it into an http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.41[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report-procedure.v0]

After surgery the surgeon document what was done in a surgery protocol. A mock up of that screen is given below. This form has the purpose to document what kind of procedures was performed by which actor. This information is used as data basis for the public reporting and a lots of other business intelligence topics.

To document what was performed we use the careflow step `Procedure completed` with current state `completed`. The description for this careflow step is: The procedure has been performed and all associated clinical activities completed. 

Then we do a trick do document start and end of the procedure: 

[cols="1,1,3,5", options="header"]
|===
|Name | Context name | Path | Description 
| Scheduled date/time
| Procedure start
|/content[openEHR-EHR-ACTION.procedure.v1]/description[at0001]/items[at0066]
|The  intention for this step is _The date and/or time on which the procedure is intended to be performed._ But since the current state is `completed` we will intepret this as the actual start time when the procedure was started. 
|Final end date/time 
|Procedure end
|/content[openEHR-EHR-ACTION.procedure.v1]/description[at0001]/items[at0060]
|The intention for this step is _The date and/or time when the entire procedure, or the last component of a multicomponent procedure, was finished._. And for this action instance with state `completed` we intepret this as the actual time when the procedure ended. 
|Time 
|Report time
|/content[openEHR-EHR-ACTION.procedure.v1]/time 
|Since the careflow step is `Procedure completed` and current state is `completed` we will set this RM attribute to the datetime when the report where created
