= Surgery and openEHR archetypes 

== Background
Surgery is an important activity in hospitals. It requires good planning, quality in execution and the right post-operative documentation. 

1. Surgery is requested using http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.476[openEHR-EHR-INSTRUCTION.request-procedure.v1] and put it into an http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.640[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.request.v1].
2. To document what was performed we use http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.16[openEHR-EHR-ACTION.procedure.v1] and  put it into an http://arketyper.no/ckm/#showArchetype_1078.36.41[openEHR-EHR-COMPOSITION.report-procedure.v0]

After surgery the surgeon document what was done in a surgery protocol. A mock up of that screen is given below. This form has the purpose to document what kind of procedures was performed by which actor. This information is used as data basis for the public reporting and a lots of other business intelligence topics.

In this note I will only cover a few topics: 

. Surgery start and end 
. Paricipations 
. Procedure codes


== Surgery start and end 

To document what was performed we use the careflow step `Procedure completed` with current state `completed`. The description for this careflow step is: The procedure has been performed and all associated clinical activities completed. 

Then we do a trick do document start and end of the procedure: 

[cols="1,1,3,8", options="header"]
|===
|Name | Context name | Path | Description 
| Scheduled date/time
| Procedure start
|/description[at0001]/items[at0066]
|The  intention for this step is _The date and/or time on which the procedure is intended to be performed._ But since the current state is `completed` we will intepret this as the actual start time when the procedure was started. 
|Final end date/time 
|Procedure end
|/description[at0001]/items[at0060]
|The intention for this step is _The date and/or time when the entire procedure, or the last component of a multicomponent procedure, was finished._. And for this action instance with state `completed` we intepret this as the actual time when the procedure ended. 
|Time 
|Report time
|/time 
|Since the careflow step is `Procedure completed` and current state is `completed` we will set this RM attribute to the datetime when the report where created 
|===


== Multiple procedures 
Many surgeries will have several procedures performed. Then the composition will containt multiple instances of ACTION.procedure. The procedure start and end for each procedure will follow the pattern defined above. 

To document the total surgery time we use the COMPOSITION.context.start_time/end_time. These attributes are defined in http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/ehr/ehr.html#_event_context_class[EVENT_CONTEXT class] like this: 

[cols="1,1,5", options="header"]
|===
|Attributes|Signature | Meaning 
|1..1|*start_time*: `DV_DATE_TIME` |	
Start time of the clinical session or other kind of event during which a provider performs a service of any kind for the patient.
|0..1|*end_time*: `DV_DATE_TIME` | 	
Optional end time of the clinical session.
|===

For all surgeries documented in DIPS Arena the total surgery time will always be documented using these attributes from the EVENT_CONTEXT. And if the surgery only have one ACTION.procedure then we will have the following. 

----
COMPOSITION.context.start_time === ACTION/description[at0001]/items[at0066] (Scheduled date/time == Procedure start time)
AND 
COMPOSITION.context.end_time === ACTION/description[at0001]/items[at0060] (Final end date/time)
----

== Participations 
Participations will be documented using the RM attributes `other_participants` which is defined for all ENTRY archetypes. 

The documentation is well defined here: http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/common/common.html#_participation_class[]

== Procedure codes 
In Norway we use NCSP codes for public reporting of procedure codes. These codes are documented here: https://ehelse.no/standarder-kodeverk-og-referansekatalog/helsefaglige-kodeverk/prosedyrekodeverkene-kodeverk-for-medisinske-kirurgiske-og-radiologiske-prosedyrer-ncmp-ncsp-og-ncrp#prosedyrekodeverkene-2018[] 

TIP: I am really sorry - there are no translations of these..... 

These procedure codes are administrative and used for financial settlement. At the same time we have no other detailed terminologies to use in Norway. Except that DIPS EMR provides a configurable terminology called _SURGERY_TYPES_ (VI-OPERASJONSTYPER). These codes are used when requesting surgery and they define the clinical procedyre that was actually performed. This is why we have chosen to use this local terminology as the _procedure name_ definition. And we will use a local CLUSTER archetype to capture the detailed NCSP (administrative) codes. 

Below is a screenshot of the template using a) the terminology _SURGERY_TYPES_ (VI-OPERASJONSTYPER) as ACTION.procedure_name and a repeating cluster _procedure details_.
