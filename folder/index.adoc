== About 
http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/common/common.html#_folder_class[FOLDER] is part of the http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/common/common.html#_directory_package[directory package]. 

This document describes some background for the implementation that DIPS AS has done of openEHR FOLDER. There are two features added: 

. <<FOLDER_DOCUMENT>> 
. <<FOLDER_TEMPLATE>> 


== Folder types

[[DIRECTORY]]
=== DIRECTORY 
A directory is a generic placeholder for content. It is expected to work just like a directory on the filesystem. 

[[FOLDER_DOCUMENT]]
=== FOLDER_DOCUMENT
This is a FOLDER which behaves almost like an Composition - but to be able to manage complex content possibly from severeal authors the content is collected and managed in an OpenEHR FOLDER.
